MCP for Omniscient Distributed Intelligence Neural [ODIN]


ðŸ“Œ What is the MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication standard that enables language models (LLMs) and agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph) to discover, invoke, and interact with external tools in a structured and auditable way.

In this project, the MCP Server acts as the control layer that bridges:

Investigator interfaces (UI, API clients, dashboards).

Forensic engines and external data sources (blockchain RPCs, graph DBs, vector DBs, OSINT feeds).

AI models and orchestration frameworks.

It provides a governed gateway where every investigation request, tool call, and response is handled in a consistent, secure, and traceable manner.


ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This MCP server is designed specifically for blockchain and cryptocurrency investigations. Its purpose is to:

Standardize how AI agents interact with forensic tools (transaction tracing, address clustering, sanctions screening, reporting).

Provide auditability and governance over model/tool usage.

Enable agentic workflows that can operate autonomously or semi-autonomously, while remaining compliant with regulatory expectations.


ðŸ›  Objectives

Interoperability: Use MCP so investigators, agents, and tools can communicate with a shared language.

Security: Enforce Zero Trust access, policy-based authorization, and tamper-evident evidence logging.

Scalability: Run on Cloudflare Workers for cloud-native, serverless, and edge-based performance.

Extensibility: Support new forensic adapters (Neo4j, Pinecone, QuickNode, OSINT APIs) without changing the core.

Auditability: Ensure every action and data flow is logged, versioned, and verifiable.

Investigator Experience: Provide clean APIs and UI integration points for human investigators, allowing AI agents to assist without becoming opaque black boxes.
